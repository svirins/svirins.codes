Install & start `tlp` & check system status. Then run `powertop` and calibrate the battery.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw --no-install-recommends
sudo apt install acpi-call-dkms
sudo tlp-stat
sudo apt install powertop
sudo powertop -c
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Keep in mind: during calibration, your screen may _go blank_ or _flicker_ for a few mins.
</Callout>

Uncomment the following lines in /etc/tlp.conf and add the desired charge start and stop percentage. (Start percentage musst be 3% higher then the stop)

```ts
START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=50
STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=80
```

Tested on: Pop!_OS 22.04 and LDME 5

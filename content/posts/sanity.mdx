Customizable Content Editor and a Feature Rich CLI

With Sanity, your content is treated as structured data and is made available through a simple and powerful API. You can edit it collaboratively and freely decide later how and where it will be distributed and used.

Features

Sanity Studio. An open-source, customizable content editing environment built with React.js that includes advanced editing features such as Block content and Structure Builder

Content Lake. A fully managed cloud data store can be accessed either by using one of the client libraries or directly via HTTP.

Content modeling with schema types

A Query Language (GROQ) can be used to retrieve collections of schema-less JSON documents.

Your Frontends and tools can be notified whenever the content is changed using real-time listeners or via webhooks, where the changes are submitted as HTTP requests to a custom URL.

Assets management, image transformations, and an Asset pipeline.

A Command Line Interface makes it easy to create new projects and set up, import, and tear down datasets.

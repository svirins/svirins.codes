> Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that initially one is reluctant to make. But once the interaction starts to provide feedback on the person's skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.

_Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience_

For me, getting into a state of flow is the only way to work productively on complex software projects.

We're going to look at some basic (and simplified) things - once you get a handle on them, you can take a big step toward productive creative work.

There are three basic resources underlying the emergence of the Flow state. They are **Time**, **Information**, and **Energy**.

In order to achieve the desired state, you must first invest each of the three resources in sufficient quality and quantity.

### Time

- do not schedule any other activities for this time;
- isolate your creative space from external distractors;
- if you have hard time constraints, it is better to put a timer ‚Äúout‚Äù so that anxiety does not interfere with your concentration;

### Information

- gather all the information you need, prepare tools and materials you may need during the process;
- if the level of difficulty of the task exceeds your level of knowledge, skills, or abilities at the moment - get training on the subject, or select the part of the task, which you can handle right now;
- determine metrics for success and progress;

### Energy

- the goal must be meaningful to us personally;
- try to start with the hardest part;
- the most important thing is (just) to begin to act;

Usually, when the flow has started, our level of energy and power exceeds our daily level, we can do more, and our level of skill increases as well.
On the way out, we feel energized. Despite the hard work, we do not feel exhausted, maybe just a pleasant fatigue or even a rush of energy and emotional lift.

### How long can you stay in a flow state?

The brain can‚Äôt stay in flow all the time. In a creative, flow state, the mind works optimally for about 90 minutes to 2 hours. You can make the most of this time with techniques like the Pomodoro method. Focused periods alternated with brief periods of rest allow your brain to be it's most efficient and creative without triggering burnout.

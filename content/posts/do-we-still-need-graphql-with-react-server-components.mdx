You should read this, it's **very important**.
You _might_ want to read this.
~~Never mind~~ - it wasn't _that_ important.

Let's try a few `combinations`:
**This text is strong, ~~this text is strong with strikethrough~~, and _this text is formatted with strong emphasis_**
***This text is formatted with strong emphasis too.***

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

> Use quote blocks to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

```
action: function(ctx) {
    workflow.check(!ctx.issue.isChanged('votes'), workflow.i18n('Voting for a resolved issue is not allowed.'));
},
```

1. Fix usability problem
2. Clean up the page
   * Make the headings bigger
2. Push my changes
3. Create code review
   * Describe my changes
   * Assign reviewers
     * Ask for feedback

Using WebSockets, instead of HTTP, does have tradeoffs. There might be additional latency on the first request setup, but subsequent requests are faster. There's an [RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9220.pdf) for WebSockets with `HTTP/3` which would remove that extra network roundtrip.
